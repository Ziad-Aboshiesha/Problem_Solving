# Problem Solving Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems that I've solved on platforms like **HackerRank** and **LeetCode**. The problems are organized into categories, and each solution is accompanied by an analysis of its time and space complexity. The code is written in **C#** for algorithmic problems and **SQL** for database-related challenges.
